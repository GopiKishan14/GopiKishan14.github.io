### Abstract
This is a report for reproducibility challenge of NeurlIPS’19 on the paper Competitive
gradient descent [(Schäfer et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12103). The paper introduces a novel algorithm for the numerical computation of Nash equilibria of competitive two-player
games. It avoids oscillatory and divergent behaviors seen in alternating gradient
descent.
The purpose of this report is to critically examine the reproducibility of the
work by <i>(Schäfer et al., 2019)</i>, within the framework of the NeurIPS 2019 Reproducibility
Challenge. The experiments replicated in this report confirms the
results of the original study. Moreover, this project offers a Python(Pytorch
based) implementation of the proposed CGD algorithm which can be found at
the GitHub public git repository.
