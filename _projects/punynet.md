This project is developed for MicroNet: Large-Scale Model Compression Competition, a model compression challenge hosted at NeurIPS'19.
We trained and quantized a resnet18 on CIFAR100 dataset.
The approach was of learning a codebook C that minimizes the difference between the output activations and their reconstructions. Click for a detailed description.
