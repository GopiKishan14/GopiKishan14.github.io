This project aims at stabilising a two-wheeled robot (naturally in non-equilibrium) using Reinforcement Learning. \
A virtual bot is created using ROS URDF and PyBullet is used to simulate physics. Q-learning is used as a Learning algorithm for the agent implemented using deep Q-Network, a deep neural network. \
