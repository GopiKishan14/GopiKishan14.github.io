This repository contains python script for the object detection on Raspberry Pi in real time using OpenCV. It uses a already trained MobileNet Architecture stored as Caffe Model. This model uses Single Shot Detection(SSD) algorithm for prediction.
It contains : 
* Guideline to run this project.
* Abstract Code WalkThrough
* Basic Learning Resources
    * Raspberry Pi
    * OpenCV
* Fun Project for Contributors. Reference Materials
    * A blog from OpenCV
    * A video from sentdex (pythonprogramming.net)
