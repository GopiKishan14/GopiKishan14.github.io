This blog explains method proposed in the paper Competitive gradient descent [(Schäfer et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12103). This has been written as a supplimentary to the reproducibility report for reproducibility challenge of NeurIPS’19. The report has been published on arXiv. It can be seen at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10820] with this github [repository](https://github.com/GopiKishan14/Reproducibility_Challenge_NeurIPS_2019) as its source.

The aim of this blog is to give a gentle introduction to the original paper. Follow this [link](https://gopikishan14.github.io/Reproducibility_Challenge_NeurIPS_2019/README.html) to read the blog. It can also be seen in [slides](https://gopikishan14.github.io/Reproducibility_Challenge_NeurIPS_2019/README.slides.html) format.

The blog also contains the implementation details of the conjugate gradient algorithm in python3 which is a component of the proposed algorithm, which itself can be seen in this jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/GopiKishan14/Reproducibility_Challenge_NeurIPS_2019/blob/master/Optimiser.ipynb). Code in python3 (based on PyTorch)
