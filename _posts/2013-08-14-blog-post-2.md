This is a blog explains method proposed in the paper Competitive gradient descent [(Schäfer et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12103). This has been written as a supplimentary to the reproducibility report for reproducibility challenge of NeurlIPS’19. The pdf format of the report is present [here](https://gopikishan14.github.io/Reproducibility_Challenge_NeurIPS_2019/index.html) with this github [repository](https://github.com/GopiKishan14/Reproducibility_Challenge_NeurIPS_2019) as its source.


This projects brings a gentle introduction to the original paper through this [blog](https://gopikishan14.github.io/Reproducibility_Challenge_NeurIPS_2019/README.html) which can be seen as supplementary to the reproducibility report. It can also be seen as [slides](https://gopikishan14.github.io/Reproducibility_Challenge_NeurIPS_2019/README.slides.html) format. The blog also contains the implementation details of the conjugate gradient algorithm in python3 which is a component of the proposed algorithm, which itself can be seen in this jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/GopiKishan14/Reproducibility_Challenge_NeurIPS_2019/blob/master/Optimiser.ipynb). Code in python3 (based on PyTorch)
