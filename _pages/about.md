About Me
--------

I am Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) undergraduate at IIT Roorkee in my final year.
I am familiar with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Computer Science Fundamentals, with a specific interest in Computer Vision, Bayesian Learning and Representation Learning. I have working experience in Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, scikit-learn and other relevant libraries.
